#summary How to implement and run a clusterfest basic installation

This section takes the terminology from [understanding understanding clusterfest]

==Steps to have a running installation==
You must:

 * server-side:
    * configure the server (tell it where the nodes are and what modules to use)
    * run the server (start clusterfest and its web server)
    * Use a webbrowser to access the frontend
 * node-side:
    * add clustering code (add code that will enable the RPC listener on the node)
    * run the nodes 

==Configuring the server==

Configuration of the server is done in the {{{clustering.properties}}} config file. This file imports defaults from {{{clustering.properties.defaults}}} file that can be found inside the distribution jar.

Here you can config:

 * {{{clustering.nodes}}}: the list of nodes in the form address:port or address:port:installDir
 * {{{clustering.modules}}}: the list of modules in the form moduleName:moduleClass. The module class must be a subclass of {{{NodeContainerModule}}} and have an empty constructor.

And extra module configuration can be added here

==Running the server==

Running the server means executing the {{{main}}} method in {{{com.flaptor.clustering.HTTPClusteringServer}}} with the port as a parameter

a {{{start.sh}}} is provided that starts clusterfest in port 47050

also there is {{{status.sh}}} (tells you if it is running) and {{{stop.sh}}} (kills the server)
