= Clusterfest at a glance =

Clusterfest helps you manage a multimachine installation in a centralized manner. These are the basic concepts to understand clusterfest.

== Nodes ==
Say your application is a distributed application, so you will have several computers run your application code. We will call these computers *nodes*:

== Cluster Manager ==

Clusterfest provides a *cluster manager*, which communicates to all the nodes in your application:

== Node Listener ==

For this to work, nodes must add a little piece of code called *node listener*, that listens for connections from clusterfest. These connections are done via *XMLRPC*

== Webapp ==

So how do you use clusterfest? Clusterfest provides a *webapp* to interact with the cluster manager via web. This is done by executing the *http clusterfest server*:
