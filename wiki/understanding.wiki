#summary Understanding how clusterfest works

= Understanding Clusterfest =

Clusterfest helps you manage a multimachine installation in a centralized manner. We will see the concepts necessary to understand how does clusterfest do this and to allow you to add new functionality.

== Nodes ==
Say your application is a distributed application, so you will have several computers run your application code. We will call these computers *nodes*:

== Cluster Manager ==

Clusterfest provides a *cluster manager*, which communicates to all the nodes in your application:

== Clusterable Listener ==

For this to work, nodes must have a clusterable listener

==Modules==

Functionality in clusterfest is provided by modules. These modules run in the server and communicate to some module listener on the nodes.

The core is the {{{Cluster}}} class: it registers the nodes and modules. Each module decides if a node is of interest to it, and if so registers it in the module. Ie: the {{{Monitor}}} module registers every {{{Node}}} that is monitoreable (exports the {{{Monitoreable}}} interface) as a {{{MonitorNode}}}

==Communication==

Clusterfest works in java so nodes and server will be running JVMs. Communication will be established in the direction server -> nodes, so if there is no server the nodes will not suffer any overhead. Also, this means that the server will know where the nodes are but not the other way around.

The server runs in a dedicated jvm. The nodes run the client code and clusterfest library that listenes on a port for connections from the server. Communication is done through RPC. The server executes (via xmlrpc) remote methods on the nodes.

For a node to be registered in clusterfest it must export the {{{Clusterable}}} interface. Then it can export other interfaces corresponding to other modules ({{{Monitoreable}}}, {{{Controllable}}}, etc).
