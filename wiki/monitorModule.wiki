= Monitor Module=

The Monitor module helps easily monitor nodes and detect problems in those nodes. It works in two phases:

 * the server requests properties to the nodes (properties, logs and systemproperties)
 * the server runs a checker to determine the state of the node

This state can be visually seen as a dashboard in the clusterfest webapp. Also you can check these properties and past states for each node.

== Checkers ==

Checkers are associated with node types in the {{{clustering.properties}}} file. For type {{{NODE_TYPE}}}

{{{
clustering.monitor.checker.NODE_TYPE=somePackage.NodeTypeCheckerClassName
}}}

{{{somePackage.NodeTypeCheckerClassName}}} must be an implementation of the {{{NodeChecker}}} interface and have an empty constructor.
