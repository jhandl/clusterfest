= Internals of the !ClusterManager =

To be able to add new functionality, you have to understand the !ClusterManager. At all times the ClusterManager has a representation of the cluster in its memory. This is a list of *node descriptors*,each holding the information of its corresponding node:

These node descriptors know the host and port where the corresponding node listener is listening, what type of node it is, and other information. They also know if that node is reachable or not. Suppose that Node 1 is not responding, the node descriptor 1 will be marked as *unreachable*:

The cluster manager maintains a representation of the cluster and knows when nodes are fallen, but that alone is not very useful. Functionality in clusterfest is added through *modules*, which are contained also in the clustermanager:
