#summary Creating and adding a custom module

= Adding a module =

A module provides some functionality over some or all the nodes of the clustering framework. A typical module contains server and node side code.

You can check all this with the [http://clusterfest.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/com/flaptor/clustering/monitoring/ Monitor module]

== Creating the module server-code ==

To create a module you must make a subclass of {{{NodeContainerModule}}}. This abstract class already has implemented most of the functionality for registering nodes. You will have to implement these methods:

{{{
abstract public boolean nodeBelongs(Node node) throws NodeUnreachableException;
}}}
to determine if a node belongs to this module (maybe not all nodes belong). If the node is unreachable you can throw a NodeUnreachableException and leave that question for later.

{{{
abstract protected ModuleNode createModuleNode(Node node)
}}}
if the node belongs, it will ask you to create a {{{ModuleNode}}} for that node, which will be registered in the module. This is where you can store information of the node.

{{{
abstract public boolean updateNode(ModuleNode node);
}}}
this is optional, if you have something to update in the node, it will be called periodically.
